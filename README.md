# Hi there, I'm FasterMars (He / Him) 👋

## - What do I do?
    I work on hobby projects in my spare time and like to experiment with different ways to write better code,
    and learn to improve the way I write code.
    I started a group called Lumière labs back in 2020 with a group of friends, writing code for the purpose of 
    fun, enjoyment and learning, having something to look after. 
    We didn't even know GitHub was a thing back then, and now with the flow of time, we have adapted to industry
    standards.
